    <p>The first activity I completed was the second one available the objective was to install multiple browsers and compare them. After installing multiple browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and OperaGX I have concluded that some have different objectives to tailor to its user and some are straightforward. Browsers like Firefox and Chrome have the idea of being a streamlined browser for general use of anyone, A browser like OperaGX is tailored to be useful to people in the Gaming space. The importance of personalized browsers is a marketing play to get users to use your browser because it has a gimic. All and all differing browsers have their purposes generally they are commercial but some have other goals behind them. </p>
 
    <p>The Second activity I'm choosing to highlight is activity five, this activity was focused on extensions and plug-ins for browsers. The goal of this activity was to get the reader familiar with the idea of extensions and how to add and remove them as well as inform the participant on how they are helpful to a user. After completing the activity you can see how sometimes these extensions can be helpful to users, Some extensions can help with grammatical errors in writing using AI to detect errors and some can block unwanted pop-ups that may be annoying to some users. These extensions and plug-ins allow the user to customize and either help protect or assist users with whatever they may be doing on the internet. </p>
