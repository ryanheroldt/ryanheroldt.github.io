    <p>Activity one's goal is to inform and teach the reader about three separate basic principles, Basics, Technology, and lastly Connectivity. These three principles are the core of the internet fundamentals as a whole. Something I found useful from this first part of the activity was the idea of hyperlinks, hyperlinks are super important in making articles and reading online much cleaner allowing direct links to types of information. Something I found important from the second part of the activity was the highlighting of concerns and dangers on the internet, which informs the reader about the issues that could arise while using the internet and is important to safety when a problem arises. Lastly, in the third part of the activity I found the structure of how internet connectivity works was super important for readers to understand how a user connects and what processes go into it. Activity one teaches the reader basic internet fundamentals that keep you informed and safe while using the internet.</p>

    <p>The Second activity I completed was the second option on the activities page, in this activity, I learned about various shortcuts to have an easier and more fluid experience while using the internet. The highlights from this activity that I would like to bring light to are as follows; two of the most useful things I learned from this activity were first, the differences in File extensions on and around computers / the internet understanding these extensions will allow you to evaluate and understand what each file on the internet is and what it could do. The second piece of information that I found to be important was the different keyboard shortcuts, these shortcuts are important because they allow us to have an easier time navigating different programs and just general internet/computer activities. all this section gave great and informative advice on how to navigate and give yourself an easier time when using the internet.
