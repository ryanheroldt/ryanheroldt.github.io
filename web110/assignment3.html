    <p>The first activity that I completed from the Wikiversity page was Number One which was all about emails. The main purpose and explanation of this activity was to teach the reader the basics of formatting for emails that people use generally and the basic shortcuts that can be used while writing an email. This section was generally helpful to anyone who reads because while it was very basic it provides a nice reminder of some of the shortcuts that are provided as well as a refresher for proper formatting when writing an email. All and all this activity while basic is extremely informative for any type of user. <p>
  
    <p>The second activity that I completed from the Wikiversity page was titled "Internet Fundamentals: Emails" was the second activity. This activity had you create and test an email account by emailing and replying to someone. This activity was quite simple but to someone who may be unfamiliar with email this may have been useful to help them get into the protocol of sending email messages, this will allow them to view how the system works and allow them to have an overall better understanding of the practice. <p>
  
    <p>The activity I chose from the Wikiversity page titled "Internet Fundamentals: Social Media" was the first one. The first activity revolved around social media and the different types. The activity was very detailed in what type of social media did what and the features they had. This activity was quite simple and while it didn't have a to of actual information in my opinion to a new user this activity helps allow you to understand the popular forms of social media on the internet and why someone may use said social media. <p>
  
    <p>The activity I chose from the Wikiversity page titled "Internet Fundamentals: Communications" was the first one. In this activity, we learned about various communication services and platforms that are provided on the Internet. The highlights from this activity inform the user about different types of information services such as mailing lists or newsgroups. The second part of this activity delved into more technical "Information Retrieval Services" the highlights of this being VERONICA or Archie, which are types of databases that hold data. The activity ends by explaining the networking behind the WWW (World Wide Web). all and all this activity was very informative to any users as it dived into more in-depth topics and focused on some more critical types of information. <p>
