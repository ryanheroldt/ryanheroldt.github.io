    <p>Activity one's goal is to inform and teach the reader about three separate basic principles, Basics, Technology, and lastly Connectivity. These three principles are the core of the internet fundamentals as a whole. Something I found useful from this first part of the activity was the idea of hyperlinks, hyperlinks are super important in making articles and reading online much cleaner allowing direct links to types of information. Something I found important from the second part of the activity was the highlighting of concerns and dangers on the internet, which informs the reader about the issues that could arise while using the internet and is important to safety when a problem arises. Lastly, in the third part of the activity I found the structure of how internet connectivity works was super important for readers to understand how a user connects and what processes go into it. Activity one teaches the reader basic internet fundamentals that keep you informed and safe while using the internet.</p>
