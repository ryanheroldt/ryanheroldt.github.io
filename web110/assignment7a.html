    <p>The plan for my final project is to reflect and describe how to successfully implement CSS into HTML Documents, This is an issue as you know I struggle with in this class so I thought it would be perfect to do my final project now that I've gotten the hang of it. The task is me completing this initial purpose, Task two will be me completing assignment 7b, and task three will be me brainstorming and starting to create a script for the video I will be creating. Task four will be me finalizing that script, Task five will be recording the video, and task six will be me finalizing anything else before submitting the project. </p>
