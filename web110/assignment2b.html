    <p>The first activity I completed was activity two I wanted to highlight this one because it's important to choose a web browser that you are comfortable with. In my experience using the internet, I've used several browsers from OperaGX to Firefox but for this activity, I compared the Four recommended ones Google, Bing Yahoo, and Ask. After testing each interface I have concluded that Google is the most streamlined browser and offers the easiest interface specifically I enjoy the AI features they have recently implemented that give specified tutorials based on your search so for example if I had searched "How to get to my settings on Windows" an AI-generated guide would pop up teaching me how to do this. <p>
