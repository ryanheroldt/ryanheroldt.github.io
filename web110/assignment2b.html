    <p>The first activity I completed was activity two I wanted to highlight this one because it's important to choose a web browser that you are comfortable with. In my experience using the internet, I've used several browsers from OperaGX to Firefox but for this activity, I compared the Four recommended ones Google, Bing Yahoo, and Ask. After testing each interface I have concluded that Google is the most streamlined browser and offers the easiest interface specifically I enjoy the AI features they have recently implemented that give specified tutorials based on your search so for example if I had searched "How to get to my settings on Windows" an AI-generated guide would pop up teaching me how to do this. <p>
    
    <p>The other activity I wanted to highlight was Activity Six this activity involved testing the Wayback machine. This feature is extremely interesting and very useful depending on how you use it. It's interesting due to its ability to essentially view any page throughout the existence of the internet, you can see how it develops. The reason it's useful is because you can use it for research methods to see how some things have developed over years or in some cases use it to view changes that may have been "swept under the rug" viewing back you can compare these changes to the current page to understand what has and has not changed about the page. <p>
