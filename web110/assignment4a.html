    <p>The First activity I wanted to highlight from the Wikiversity page is titled "Internet Fundamentals: Networking" The activity I'm choosing to write about is the second one. In this activity, the user must go over the protocol for Windows and troubleshoot Wi-Fi Connections. this activity is super important as it teaches the user how to fix and troubleshoot issues with their connectivity on their giving tutorials on what to do if a problem like this occurs. This activity can be applied by any user and would be super helpful in any event that may occur. <p>

    <p>The second activity I wanted to highlight from the Wikiversity page is titled "Internet Fundamentals: Networking" The activity I'm choosing to write about involves researching OS prices. So after doing research, I can conclude technically, Mac OS is the most expensive system as it is only available with Apple products. Windows OS keys generally range between 10-30 USD and Linux is free. Windows OS is the highest-rated and most widely used and for the price point it's very fair but it seems if you going for a budget computer that isn't going to be used intensively something with Linux will be the best bet. <p>
