    <p>The First activity I wanted to highlight from the Wikiversity page is titled "Internet Fundamentals: Networking" The activity I'm choosing to write about is the second one. In this activity, the user must go over the protocol for Windows and troubleshoot Wi-Fi Connections. this activity is super important as it teaches the user how to fix and troubleshoot issues with their connectivity on their giving tutorials on what to do if a problem like this occurs. This activity can be applied by any user and would be super helpful in any event that may occur. <p>
