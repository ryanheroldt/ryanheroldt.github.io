        <p>This semester I learned alot about the basics of HTML and basic principals and ideas that you should be implementing into any strain of HTML document when it comes to web design. I picked CSS for my final project because I had difficulties understanding the implementation and purpose during this semester and now that I understand it better I believe it to be the perfect thing to implement into my Final Project.</p>
