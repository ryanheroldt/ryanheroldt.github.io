    <p>In this assignment we were required to go back and use the W3C Markup Validator to check for any issue with our code. Doing this I found several small misshaps within my code such as leaving different type of p's open ended, Lack of titles and defineing the eng under my html's. Doing this assignment made me realize how unneat some of my coding was and that I need to be weary because the issues with my coding could cause unintenional issues.</p>
