    <p>The first activity I want to go over is the second one available in this the user needs to look at different security measures on different browsers, this activity is super useful for the user unaware of the different security persuasions that users can take advantage of while using a web browser. I thought the Google Chrome security settings were super friendly and I use their security precautions often for my personal use. <p>
  
    <p>The second activity I want to go over is the third activity. In this activity, you are told to run an anti-virus scan on your computer. I used the base Windows 10 anti-virus scan and completed a full scan of my computer with no issues on it. Understanding how to use your anti-virus is super important when using a computer as in case of an emergency understanding how to use it is super beneficial to any desktop user to keep themselves and their information safe. <p>
