<p style="color:red;">This activity for me was very interesting, I obviously submitted it late through trail and error, I did not fully understand the assignment which is why I believe I struggled so much, in the futre I definantly need to pay closer attention because after the intructor pointed out to me my errors, it was quite simple.</p>
